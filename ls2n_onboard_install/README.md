Installation on companion computer
----------------
Those scripts are here to help install the environment on a companion computer.

You can run the script *first_intall.sh* to install the environment on a companion computer with ubuntu server 20.04.
Please note that you might want to modify the serial_configure script depending on the port to which you connect your
autopilot.

The *update_build* script can be used later on to update a specific package on the drone.

Those scripts work assuming that your drone user and password are "drone" (this can be modified).
