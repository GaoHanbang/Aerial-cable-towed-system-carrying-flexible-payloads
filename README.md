# Aerial-cable-towed-system-carrying-flexible-payloads
This repository is the ROS2 Gazebo simulation part of my master thesis, named 'Modelling, Simulation, and Control of a Novel Aerial Cable Towed System for Agile Operation'.  The research is funded by Laboratoire des Sciences du Numerique de Nantes (LS2N), under the supervision of prof. Stéphane CARO and Abdelhamid CHRIETTE.
